Driving Gaussian plus is a 3D reconstruction and editing method for Surrounding Dynamic Driving Scenes based on 3D Gaussian.
With panoramic videos and sensor priors as input,  it performs high-quality 3D Gaussian reconstruction of static backgrounds and dynamic foreground objects, and supports effective multiple edits to the reconstructed scene.
Reconstruction and Editable Simulation for Surrounding Dynamic Driving Scenes
Firstly, Driving Gaussianplus reconstructs the driving scene using 3D Gaussian based on the input images and lidar points. 
After the reconstruction, Driving GaussianPlus can perform multi-task editing on the 3D scene according to user needs, including texture insertion, weather transformation, and object manipulation.
We develop a 3D Gaussian  foreground bank for driving scenarios, which supports fast and consistent object manipulation into 3D scenes.
